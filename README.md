This project is about house price prediction.


This project is about predicting the price of a house. As it is well known that the price of houses are in the thousands of dollars (basically lots of money is at stake). So the decision of owning a house of an average family or a person is a big one , for most it involves saving of lifetime or to have a huge burden of loan. If real estate companies dealing in houses, apartments,flats etc are able to offer a house at a reasonable rate, it would immensely help their clients.Most of the customers take a good amount of time (sometimes upto a year or more) in deciding which property to buy, where to buy etc. So here the role of the real estate companies becomes crucial, if they have a good idea of what a property would cost over a period of time they can pass that info to their clients. Though the price of a property is determined by many factors such as location, connectivity, amenities, size etc. Here I am using data from UCI machine learning repository (Boston housing data) and build a supervised learning model for predicting the price of the house.

Companies dealing in buying and selling of property such as housing.com, 99 acres.com and more can use this model or similar model in serving their clients better, helping them in decision making and providing attractive offers. This model can increase the customer base and even enhance the reputation of the company. Companies can even build an application which would show how much the cost of property would increase over time, how many people are interested in a particular property.
